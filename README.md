### Thesis project by  Giorgio Olivieri

This is the thesis project for three-year degree (in italy is called "laurea triennale") in "Computer and automation engineering" UNIVPM (https://www.univpm.it/Entra/)

This project is based on Laravel v6 ( https://laravel.com/docs/6.x ) and is a web application  for an electrical car dealership to manage your cars and customers. 

The main focus is the real time monitoring of battery data both for customer and seller from a dataset. In this case there's not a MQTT service for real time uploading od battery data  but the db was manually populated with data from a real car. 

To test the web app see the file "istruzioni.pdf"
